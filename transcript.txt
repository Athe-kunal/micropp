If I were  
22 right now and graduating college, I would 
feel like the luckiest kid in all of history.  
Why? Because there's never been a more amazing 
time to go create something totally new, to go  
invent something, to start a company, whatever 
it is. I think it is probably possible now to  
start a company that is a oneperson company that 
will go on to be worth like more than a billion  
dollars and more importantly than that deliver an 
amazing product and service to the world and that  
that is like a crazy thing. You have access to 
tools that can let you do what used to take teams  
of hundreds and you just have to like you know 
learn how to use these tools and come up with a  
great idea and it's it's like quite amazing.
